### Hello World :seedling:
> My first algorithm in Ruby.<br>
> It takes the user input and shows that in this format:<br>
> "Hello World, #{text}."

### Fibonacci's Odd Sum :herb:
> Returns the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers upto and including the passed number 
> if it is a Fibonacci number. As an example, passing 4 to the function should returns 
> 5 because all the odd Fibonacci numbers under 4 are 1, 1, and 3.
